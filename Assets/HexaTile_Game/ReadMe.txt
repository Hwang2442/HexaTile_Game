Hello!!

This is a simple instruction manual for this game.

1. You can set the grid. The Maximum is 9. You can modify it in the script if you want.

2. You can set the number of obstacles at startup. It will have the biggest impact on the difficulty of the game.

Finally, an easy A* algorithm is included. I think this algorithm will help junior developers.

Thank you!!
